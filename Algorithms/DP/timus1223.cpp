 *
 * Strategy:
 * Ideally, given enough eggs, we would do a simple binary search to find E and derive our actual 
 * solution from this since we can break all the eggs that we want. However, if the number of eggs 
 * are limited, we might want to have the binary cut be closer to the ground in case we run out of 
 * eggs and have to try one floor at a time with our last egg. We find the actual solution by 
 * dynamic programming: If we have calculated the solutions A[s, t] for all s < e and all t < v,
 * where e is the number of eggs and v is the number of floors, we can try a solution for s = e 
 * and t = v by considering binary cut at floors k, for all 1 <= k <= v. Such a cut means we will 
 * recurse either by breaking an egg and continuing at A[s-1, t-1] or not breaking the egg and 
 * continuing with e eggs on the t-k upper floors with a total number of steps given by A[s, t-k],
 * with the worst case being the maximum of these two cases.
 * The solution for A[s, t] is then the minimum of all these solutions for the different k's, plus
 * one try.
 *
 * To optimize this, we note that given a higher than logarithmic amount of eggs to any given floor
 * we know the answer directly (just a binary search with a logarithmic amount of tries), and that
 * the trials for 1 <= k <= v yield a a convex pattern of results.
 *
 * Performance:
 * Roughly O(N log N) where N is 1000, which in practice solves the test cases in 0.015s which is
 * faster than all but very few submissions, and uses 2156KB of memory.
